Draw a dragon curve of degree `n`.

## Dragon curve

The [Heighway Dragon Curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_curve#Heighway_dragon) is a fractal curve that looks like this for degrees `n>0`:

A dragon curve of degree `n=0` is a single line segment. 

To go from degree `n` to degree `n + 1`, replace each segment in the previous curve with 2 segments at right angles as in the image. Notice to which side of the line the new segments are placed.
